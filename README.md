## Overview
  In this project, you will step into the shoes of a web UI designer and front-end developer for a cinemas and theaters management company, helping to enable users to book and view their seats smoothly across different devices.

## Project Objectives
  1.  Prototype a responsive seat map visual layout maximizing cross-device usage
  2.  Connect the visual seat map to a grid of seats (columns and rows) to be used for booking
  3.  Change the controls dynamically, depending on screen size, to increase booking completions

## Layout Example

  Sugarland Theaters has provided you with an example of one their cinemas layout:

## Your Challenge

  Your task will be to create a responsive movie and theaters seat booking user interface.  To do this, you will create a responsive visual layout, map the seats to a grid that can be later connected to the rest of the parent app, and change UI controls, depending on screen size, in order to provide a better experience and maximize seat bookings.
  
  In this project we won't use any specific data or direction: you will apply your own ideas to design the UI the way you think it can be most valid.
  
  After you develop your prototype, you will share your findings.

## Summary
  As this is a simple single page project, I went for a path to review and improve even for a bit my skills in pure HTML, CSS and JS. The biggest challenge for me was to make the code more reusable.


## Solution
  For responsiveness I used @media only screen and (min-width ) along with the use of classes for items which would have similarities in the way they work, if not the same. The use of ID to be used in JS mainly and for its differentiation in CSS


## Approach
  As I said before, I went down a path of reviewing the basics, for this I only used HTML, CSS and JS. To make this page complete and responsive, as I'm not UX Design and it seems like I'm not very good at it, I went to the mall and took photos of the totem there to... inspire me, let's say haha.

  After having this inspiration, I made the page from scratch, using what I already did, but improving it.
