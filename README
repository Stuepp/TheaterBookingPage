## Overview
  In this project, you will step into the shoes of a web UI designer and front-end developer for a cinemas and theaters management company, helping to enable users to book and view their seats smoothly across different devices.

## Project Objectives
  .1  Prototype a responsive seat map visual layout maximizing cross-device usage
  .2  Connect the visual seat map to a grid of seats (columns and rows) to be used for booking
  .3  Change the controls dynamically, depending on screen size, to increase booking completions

## Layout Example

  Sugarland Theaters has provided you with an example of one their cinemas layout:

## Your Challenge

  Your task will be to create a responsive movie and theaters seat booking user interface.  To do this, you will create a responsive visual layout, map the seats to a grid that can be later connected to the rest of the parent app, and change UI controls, depending on screen size, in order to provide a better experience and maximize seat bookings.
  
  In this project we won't use any specific data or direction: you will apply your own ideas to design the UI the way you think it can be most valid.
  
  After you develop your prototype, you will share your findings.
